  noteTitle: Field Lab Overview (Day 3)
  noteContent: 'Author: Dr. Selene Hart



    Early laboratory analysis reveals
    that several island materials behave similarly to Earth elements despite having
    entirely foreign compositions. A metallic sample conducted electricity almost
    identically to copper, while another reinforced framing tests like low-grade
    iron. Even a brittle crystalline form demonstrated bonding behavior reminiscent
    of carbon structures.



    These substitutes appear naturally occurring and
    surprisingly consistent, though their broader effects remain unknown.'
