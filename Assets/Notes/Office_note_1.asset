  noteTitle: Field Lab Overview (Day 3)
  noteContent: "Author: Dr. Selene Hart\n\nOur first round of lab tests confirms
    that many island materials behave like strangely altered versions of Earth elements.
    For example, one metallic shard pulled from a collapsed tree conducted electricity
    nearly identical to copper, even though its surface structure resembled nothing
    metallic at all. Another sample\u2014bright gray and flaky\u2014reinforced structural
    beams during stress testing almost exactly like low-grade iron.\n\nEven more
    surprising was a brittle red crystal that bonded to itself when exposed to mild
    heat, mimicking carbon-based adhesive reactions. These properties repeat across
    samples taken from opposite ends of the island, which suggests these \u201Csubstitutes\u201D
    are naturally occurring rather than rare anomalies.\n\nThe most concerning trend
    is consistency. Materials with copper-like behavior always conduct like copper.
    Materials with iron-like behavior always strengthen under pressure. None of these
    samples vary in their role, even if their structure and appearance change.\n\nIt\u2019s
    becoming clear that the island is generating entire families of materials designed
    to fill specific chemical functions. We expected unpredictable chaos\u2014but
    instead, we\u2019re finding something disturbingly organized."

  innerDialogueAfterClose: "They act just like copper, iron, carbon\u2026 but look
    nothing like them.\nIf the substitutes really work, maybe I can pull this off.
    The pod repairs might not be impossible after all."
