  noteTitle: ' Final Attempt Log (Day 20)'
  noteContent: "Author: Dr. Ishikawa\r\n\r\nRepeated attempts to reach the activation
    console have failed. Composite-0 has adapted to our presence; days of exposure
    have allowed trace analog particles to enter our bloodstream. The material now
    reacts to us as if we are part of the island\u2019s internal system.\r\n\r\nWhen
    we approach the activation alcove, Composite-0 initiates defensive crystallization\u2014blocking
    pathways, sealing doors, and encasing equipment within seconds. The deeper we
    enter the chamber, the faster the reaction becomes. Direct detonation is no longer
    physically possible for anyone who has spent significant time on the island.\r\n\r\nSome
    discussed evacuation, but diverting even a fraction of the substitute materials
    from this chamber would dismantle the neutralization device entirely. To leave
    would be to ensure the island\u2019s continued growth\u2014and Earth\u2019s collapse.\r\n\r\nWe
    can no longer reach the console. If you are reading this, it is because the island
    has not yet \u201Crecognized\u201D you. You may be able to access what we could
    not."
