  noteTitle: ' Final Attempt Log (Day 20)'
  noteContent: "Author: Dr. Mara Ishikawa\n\nWe attempted to activate the device
    this morning. All attempts failed.\n\nComposite-0 has adapted more rapidly than
    we anticipated. After nearly three weeks of exposure, trace analog particles
    have entered our systems\u2014skin, lungs, bloodstream. We don\u2019t feel sick,
    but the island recognizes us now. Not as intruders, but as part of itself.\n\nWhen
    any of us approach the activation alcove, Composite-0 reacts immediately. Crystallized
    growth forms across the doorway, sealing it within moments. Tools become encased
    in hard mineral shells. Even protective suits begin to stiffen as the material
    bonds to their surfaces.\n\nThe closer we get to the console, the more aggressive
    the reaction becomes. For those of us who have worked here since Day 1, the alcove
    is completely unreachable.\n\nSome suggested evacuating, but removing even a
    small portion of the substitutes for repairs would collapse the device. Without
    the bomb, the island will continue draining Earth\u2014faster every day.\n\nWe\u2019ve
    concluded that none of us can finish this. The island will not let us.\n\nIf
    you\u2019re reading this, it means the island hasn\u2019t adapted to you yet.\nYou
    might be able to reach the console.\n\nPlease\u2026 do what we could not."

  innerDialogueAfterClose: "Composite-0 claimed them. Marked them. To the island,
    they became part of the system. But it hasn\u2019t adapted to me yet. I can still
    reach the console. It has to be me."
