  noteTitle: Escape Pod Repair Blueprint
  noteContent: "Author: Department of Field Logistics\n\nTo restore basic launch
    capability to the R-POD 74C escape unit, the following Earth-standard components
    must be replaced:\n\n\t-Conductive alloy plates (iron/copper mix): manage electrical
    flow across hull panels.\n\t-Stabilizer gel: prevents catastrophic vibration
    during ignition.\n\t-Micro-capacitor ignition units: store and release the burst
    of power needed for liftoff.\n\t-Reinforced carbon housing panels: maintain internal
    pressure and structure during ascent.\n\nIf standard replacements are not available,
    field personnel may attempt to locate natural materials with similar behavior.
    Identification should be based on practical traits:\n\t-Does it conduct electricity
    like metal?\n\t-Is it strong under pressure like carbon composites?\n\t-Does
    it hold a charge?\n\t-Does it tolerate high heat or impact?\n\nThe Element Translation
    Chart (Operations Manual Section 3A) lists the physical properties required for
    each component. Field agents are instructed to compare unknown materials against
    these parameters to determine potential compatibility.\n\nWarning: substitutes
    may only function for a short duration. Stability varies, and incorrect matches
    could result in engine failure or hull breach during launch.\n\nUse only if no
    certified parts are available."

    If the island has substitutes that match these, I might actually get the pod
    running again. First step: find the materials."
