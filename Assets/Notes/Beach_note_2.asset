  noteTitle: Escape Pod Repair Blueprint
  noteContent: "Author: Department of Field Logistics\r\n\r\nEmergency Repair Procedure
    \u2014 R-POD 74C\r\n\r\nTo restore minimal launch capability, the following standard
    Earth-grade components must be replaced:\r\n\r\nConductive alloy plates (Fe\u2013Cu
    composite)\r\n\r\nStabilizer gel for vibration control\r\n\r\nMicro-capacitor
    units for ignition sequencing\r\n\r\nReinforced carbon housing for structural
    integrity\r\n\r\nField technicians are advised to source equivalent materials
    from the environment if official components are unavailable. Identify and extract
    materials exhibiting comparable conductivity, density, and carbon structure.
    A complete Element Translation Chart is included in the main operations manual
    for reference.\r\n\r\nNote: Launch performance depends on accuracy of material
    matching. Nonstandard substitutions may affect stability.\r\n"
