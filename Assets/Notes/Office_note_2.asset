  noteTitle: Element Stability Review (Day 5)
  noteContent: "Author: Dr. Elias Morrow\n\nStability remains the biggest challenge.
    Every sample we remove from the immediate environment begins to degrade the moment
    it leaves the island\u2019s atmospheric and magnetic field. Some weaken slowly\u2014losing
    their structure over hours\u2014while others collapse within minutes. The degradation
    patterns aren\u2019t uniform, but they\u2019re consistent enough to prove a dependency.\n\nBased
    on controlled tests, the materials rely on something present in the island\u2019s
    local conditions. It could be atmospheric composition, a magnetic anomaly, or
    even a form of radiation we haven\u2019t identified yet. Whatever it is, the
    materials lose coherence when separated from it.\n\nFor now, engineering applications
    are technically possible, but extremely time-limited. A device built with these
    substitutes would need to be assembled and activated on-site. Long-term transport
    appears impossible.\n\nThis has forced us to rethink the original mission. We
    came to find replacements\u2014something we could extract and take home. But
    the more we work, the clearer it becomes: the island isn\u2019t offering replacements.
    It\u2019s creating dependencies."

  innerDialogueAfterClose: "So the materials break down if they\u2019re taken too
    far away\u2026\nThat means the escape window would be small\u2014too small, maybe.
    But I have to try."
