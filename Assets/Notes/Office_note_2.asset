  noteTitle: Element Stability Review (Day 5)
  noteContent: "Author: Dr. Elias Morrow\r\n\r\nTests confirm that substitute materials
    retain functional integrity only briefly outside the island\u2019s environmental
    field. Despite initial compatibility with machinery circuits and diagnostic tools,
    their structures degrade quickly the farther they get from the island\u2019s
    influence.\r\n\r\nIt suggests a dependency on local atmospheric or magnetic conditions
    that we do not yet fully understand. Engineering applications are possible, but
    time-limited."
