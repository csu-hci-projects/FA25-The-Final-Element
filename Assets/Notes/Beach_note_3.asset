  noteTitle: Project Restoration Summary (Excerpt)
  noteContent: "Author: Central Resource Preservation Initiative\r\n\r\nOngoing depletion
    of Earth\u2019s natural elements has accelerated beyond projected curves. This
    island was flagged because satellite readings detected unfamiliar material signatures
    concentrated in its soil and vegetation. These anomalies showed potential as
    functional replacements for critical Earth resources.\r\n\r\nThe stationed research
    team was tasked with evaluating whether extraction or synthesis was possible.
    Communication terminated unexpectedly five days ago."
