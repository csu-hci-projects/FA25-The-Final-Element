  noteTitle: Neutralization Integration Log (Day 19)
  noteContent: "Author: Dr. Elias Morrow\n\nThe neutralization device is now fully
    assembled. Our tests show that when the substitute materials are linked in the
    correct sequence, they generate a resonance that destabilizes the island\u2019s
    analog lattice\u2014the network responsible for producing new matter and drawing
    elements from Earth.\n\nThe effect is violent but controlled, provided activation
    follows the correct procedure. If successful, the detonation will collapse the
    island\u2019s internal structure and sever its link to Earth\u2019s elemental
    supply. Without this link, Earth\u2019s natural processes should gradually recover.\n\nImportantly,
    the device cannot be relocated or rebuilt elsewhere. The substitutes degrade
    too quickly outside this chamber, and their placement is bound to the island\u2019s
    environmental field. This is a one-use system, tied to this exact location.\n\nThe
    bomb is ready. All that remains is manual activation at the override console."

    all ready. They got this far\u2026 and then something stopped them. I can finish
    it."
