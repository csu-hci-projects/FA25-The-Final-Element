  noteTitle: 'Inventory-Based Access Protocol (Day 15) '
  noteContent: "Author: Technician Jonah Reyes\n\nComposite-0 has compromised all
    digital access systems. The Storage Room door control panel displayed corrupted
    data this morning, and the touch interface froze entirely. Standard repair tools
    are useless\u2014the material\u2019s interference scrambles electronic components
    the moment they activate.\n\nAs a workaround, I\u2019ve set up a mechanical access
    code based on physical inventory counts inside the lab. It\u2019s crude, but
    Composite-0 seems unable to interfere with manual systems.\n\nAccess Code Sequence:\n\nCount
    total flasks with blue substance.\n\nCount total Bunsen Burners.\n\nCount total
    fire extinguishers.\n\nCount total microscopes.\n\nEnter the four numbers in
    that order.\n\nThis should keep the Storage Room secure\u2026 and hopefully,
    keep Composite-0 out.."

  innerDialogueAfterClose: "If they guarded the Storage Room this hard, whatever\u2019s
    inside must be critical. Maybe the materials I need\u2026 or maybe something
    worse."
