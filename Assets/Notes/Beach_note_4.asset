  noteTitle: Resonance Crystal Field Log (Day 4)
  noteContent: "Author: Dr. Selene Hart\n\nWe\u2019ve begun field tests on the small
    crystal fragments found along the forest edge. These crystals show a strong response
    to nearby conductive material and to objects affected by Composite-0. When left
    alone, the crystal stays dim, but it glows brighter in the presence of metal,
    scanners, or anything carrying analog activity.\n\nYesterday\u2019s tests revealed
    an unexpected pattern. The resonance crystal pulsed sharply when the island leopard
    passed through the clearing. The creature has been stealing equipment for over
    a week \u2014 datapads, utility tools, a pair of handheld scanners, and now Dr.
    Hart\u2019s Level-1 keycard. With so many metallic items in its possession, the
    crystal reacted strongly to its movement.\n\nBased on repeated readings, we believe
    the leopard stores its hoarded objects in a shallow cave along the western ridge.
    The resonance glow increases consistently in that direction.\n\nImportant Behavioral
    Note:\nThis leopard sleeps more than any known variant we\u2019ve studied. It
    enters deep, extended rest cycles multiple times per day and rarely wakes to
    noise or normal movement. Even loud conversation near its den doesn\u2019t disturb
    it.\nHowever, sudden fast movement \u2014 especially sprinting past the den \u2014
    has startled it awake more than once. Approaching slowly and quietly is strongly
    advised.\n\nIf further equipment goes missing, use a resonance crystal to locate
    the den and retrieve items only while the creature is asleep."

  innerDialogueAfterClose: "So the crystal points toward stolen gear\u2026 and this
    leopard barely wakes up unless someone charges past it. If it\u2019s asleep,
    I should be able to slip in and take the keycard without a fight. Slow. Quiet.
    Don\u2019t sprint. Got it."
