  noteTitle: Elemental Drain Hypothesis (Day 12
  noteContent: "Author: Dr. Mara Ishikawa\n\nAfter reviewing the latest geological
    data from Earth and our material generation logs from the island, I believe we\u2019re
    seeing a one-to-one correspondence between disappearing Earth elements and newly
    formed substitute elements here.\n\nFor example: Earth reported a sharp decline
    in accessible iron reserves over the last two weeks. At nearly the same time,
    our team began observing a spike in iron-analog materials appearing across the
    island. The same correlation shows up with copper, carbon, and several other
    essential resource classes.\n\nThis suggests a direct relationship\u2014possibly
    even a transfer\u2014between the Earth\u2019s elemental supply and the material
    production happening on the island. The island may be drawing, siphoning, or
    replicating matter at the cost of Earth's existing reserves.\n\nWe don\u2019t
    understand the mechanism yet. Whether it\u2019s geological, atmospheric, magnetic,
    or something entirely new, the effect is unmistakable:\n\nThe more this island
    produces, the more Earth loses.\n\nIf this continues unchecked, shortages will
    escalate worldwide."

  innerDialogueAfterClose: "\u2026So every substitute here forms because the real
    element disappears back home. Iron, copper, carbon\u2026 all vanishing. The island
    isn\u2019t helping Earth\u2014it\u2019s stealing from it."
