  noteTitle: Failsafe Wiring Offset Instructions (Day 20)
  noteContent: "Author: Technician Jonah Reyes\n\nComposite-0 didn\u2019t just block
    the activation alcove\u2014it spread through the facility\u2019s wiring systems,
    corrupting primary power channels and melting several cable paths. The override
    console still functions, but it requires manual rerouting through the secondary
    conduits to bypass the damage.\n\nI traced the intact lines and mapped an alternate
    wiring sequence. If you reach the console, you\u2019ll need to connect the conduits
    in this order:\n\nRed \u2192 Purple\nBlue \u2192 Red\nGreen \u2192 Blue\nPurple
    \u2192 Green\n\nThis offset bypasses the crystallized segments and should provide
    enough power to trigger the cascade.\n\nNo one on the team can get close enough
    to test it. Composite-0 won\u2019t let us anywhere near the alcove.\n\nIf you\u2019re
    not already contaminated, this is your only shot.\n\nGood luck."

  innerDialogueAfterClose: "One wiring sequence\u2026 and the device activates. If
    I do this, there\u2019s no escape. But if I don\u2019t\u2026 the world ends.
    This was never about surviving. It was about choosing who does."
