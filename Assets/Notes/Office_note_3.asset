  noteTitle: Scanner Access Log (Day 8)
  noteContent: "Author: Technician Jonah Reyes\n\nThe biometric lock for the laboratory
    door failed again this morning. Composite-0 growth spread across the scanner
    housing overnight, causing short circuits and corrupting the calibration software.
    Even after we cleaned the growth, the system refused to recognize authorized
    staff.\n\nUntil we find a permanent fix, door access will rely on the reflex-verification
    system we installed as a backup. In short: the door opens only when someone hits
    the exact target score\u201417\u2014on the reflex test panel. Anything else resets
    the counter and locks the door again.\n\nIt\u2019s not elegant, but it works\u2026
    mostly. The system is extremely literal. Undershoot or overshoot the score by
    even a fraction and it rejects the attempt.\n\nNot ideal for a research facility,
    but given the circumstances, we don\u2019t have many options left."

    for a backup.\nWhatever. If it gets me into the lab, I\u2019ll do it."
