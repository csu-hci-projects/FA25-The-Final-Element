  noteTitle: Field Observation Log (Day 1)
  noteContent: 'Author: Dr. Mara Ishikawa



    Initial landing confirms the island
    exhibits extreme chemical anomalies. Flora maintains familiar silhouettes but
    presents radically altered material composition. Tree trunks show teal mineral
    seams instead of organic cellulose, and leaf tissues display deep red crystalline
    structures that refract light in unusual patterns.



    Soil samples include
    multiple particulate compounds not found in any Earth database. Early theory:
    the island supports formation of entirely novel matter that likely destabilizes
    when removed from its native environment.'
