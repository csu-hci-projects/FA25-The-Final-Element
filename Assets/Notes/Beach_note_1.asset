  noteTitle: Field Observation Log (Day 1)
  noteContent: "Our initial landing confirms that this island does not follow any
    familiar chemical or biological rules. At a distance, the environment looks ordinary\u2014trees,
    grass, soil\u2014but up close, everything is built from materials we\u2019ve
    never encountered.\n\nThe tree trunks are not organic at all. Instead of wood
    fibers, they contain solid teal mineral seams running in branching patterns that
    mimic veins. The leaves are thin red crystals that flex without breaking, almost
    like a hybrid between glass and cartilage. When sunlight hits them, the crystals
    bend and scatter light into strange angles, creating distorted shadows across
    the ground.\n\nEven the soil refuses to match Earth samples. When we dug a small
    trench, we found grains shaped like tiny gears and spirals, as if naturally formed
    by mechanical processes rather than erosion. Their composition doesn\u2019t map
    to any Earth element, and some of them behave oddly around our instruments\u2014slight
    magnetic interference, unexplained warmth, or sudden density shifts.\n\nEarly
    theory: the island creates new matter within its boundaries. These materials
    seem stable only while they remain here, suggesting the environment itself is
    holding them together.\n\nWhatever is happening here, it isn\u2019t natural.
    And it\u2019s much larger than we expected."

  innerDialogueAfterClose: "Teal bark, red crystal leaves\u2026 nothing here feels
    real. The scientists weren\u2019t exaggerating\u2014this place follows its own
    rules.\nI just need to get what I came for, fix the pod, and leave."
