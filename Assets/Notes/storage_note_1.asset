  noteTitle: Material Integration Log (Day 16)
  noteContent: "Author: Dr. Selene Hart\n\nWe have completed full integration of
    the island\u2019s substitute materials into the neutralization system. Every
    sample\u2014metallic shards, crystalline composites, and carbon-like structures\u2014now
    occupies a precise position within the containment racks. Each component is arranged
    according to its behavioral role: conduction, heat absorption, resonance amplification,
    or controlled instability.\n\nDuring assembly, we confirmed that many substitutes
    temporarily mimic Earth materials well enough to interface with standard machinery.
    A copper-like variant carried current almost perfectly. An iron analog reinforced
    pressure plates far beyond expected limits. These traits allowed us to build
    the foundation of the device.\n\nHowever, the drawback is unavoidable: removing
    even a single component disrupts the resonance pattern. The system depends on
    all materials remaining inside this chamber. Their interaction\u2014volatile
    as it is\u2014is what creates the chain reaction capable of severing the island\u2019s
    elemental drain.\n\nThis room is no longer a storage area.\nIt is the device.\nThe
    walls, racks, and embedded materials all contribute to its function. Any attempt
    to repurpose or remove the components for external use\u2014such as repairing
    transport equipment\u2014would dismantle the failsafe entirely.\n\nWe cannot
    risk that."

    was thinking about tearing parts out to fix the pod. If I had done that, I would've
    destroyed their only chance."
