  noteTitle: Material Integration Log (Day 16)
  noteContent: 'Author: Dr. Hart

    

    All substitute materials collected
    from the island have now been integrated into the neutralization system. Their
    unstable molecular structure, while unsuitable for long-term engineering, reacts
    with exceptional precision when embedded into the containment channels, forming
    the core of the cascade sequence.

    

    During preliminary testing, we
    confirmed that several substitutes exhibit temporary compatibility with standard
    mechanical interfaces. However, diverting any portion of these materials away
    from the containment racks compromises system integrity and prevents the neutralization
    sequence from forming.

    

    This chamber functions as a single, unified
    device. Any removal, repurposing, or reallocation of its components will render
    the failsafe inoperable.
