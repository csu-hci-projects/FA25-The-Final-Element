  noteTitle: Global Implications (Day 14)
  noteContent: "Author: Dr. Selene Hart\n\nOur updated projections are grim. If the
    island\u2019s drain effect progresses at its current rate, Earth will face severe
    biosphere destabilization within a few years. The consequences wouldn\u2019t
    just affect manufacturing or construction\u2014they would reach agriculture,
    medicine, atmospheric stability, and even basic biological processes that rely
    on specific metals and carbon structures.\n\nIn short: the planet\u2019s chemistry
    is being rewritten, one element at a time.\n\nGiven the urgency, the research
    team unanimously agreed to shift priorities. Further study is secondary. The
    island must be neutralized. We have begun designing a failsafe using the substitute
    materials themselves, despite their volatility. Early tests suggest that when
    arranged in a specific pattern, these materials create a destructive resonance
    that could sever the island\u2019s link to Earth.\n\nIt\u2019s dangerous, experimental,
    and untested. But it may be our only option."

  innerDialogueAfterClose: "If the drain keeps accelerating, the whole planet collapses.
    No metals, no medicine, no air stability. Nothing. The team didn\u2019t switch
    to a failsafe because they wanted to\u2014they had no choice."
