  noteTitle: Cross-Exposure Biological Assessment (Day 13)
  noteContent: "Author: Dr. Elijah Morrow\n\nFollowing reports of unusual fatigue
    among the research team, we conducted a series of precautionary scans to rule
    out environmental contamination. While no illness was detected, several surprising
    patterns emerged.\n\nTrace amounts of analog particulate matter \u2014 the same
    class of unstable compounds found in soil samples \u2014 were identified on clothing,
    skin, and in some cases, within shallow respiratory pathways. These particles
    appear chemically similar to Composite-0 but exist in a more diffuse, airborne
    form.\n\nAlthough the concentrations are extremely low, the particles show a
    consistent behavior: they align themselves with the body's natural electrical
    signals, almost as if they are \u201Creading\u201D or adapting to biological
    patterns. Over time, the bonding increases, though not enough to harm the host.\n\nWe
    do not yet understand the purpose or mechanism behind this. However, early modeling
    suggests prolonged exposure may cause these analog particles to treat the host
    as part of the island\u2019s environment. This may explain why the island\u2019s
    materials behave differently when handled by staff who have been here since Day
    1.\n\nFurther study is required, but a working theory is emerging:\nthe island
    doesn\u2019t just produce substitute elements\u2014\nit gradually integrates
    anything that stays within its field long enough.\n\nIf true, this could have
    implications for both material handling and long-term personnel safety."

    them. Maybe that\u2019s why their systems kept failing\u2026 why doors wouldn\u2019t
    open\u2026 Whatever changed them hasn\u2019t touched me yet. That might be my
    only advantage."
