  noteTitle: Anomalous Reaction Report (Day 8)
  noteContent: "Author: Dr. Selene Hart\n\nComposite-0\u2019s behavior continues
    to escalate beyond anything we predicted. When first collected, the material
    behaved like a harmless mineral sample\u2014dense, inert, and structurally stable.
    But once inside the lab environment, its reactions changed dramatically.\n\nThe
    material responds instantly to heat, sound vibrations, and even low-level electrical
    currents. When exposed to a running circuit, Composite-0 began creeping along
    the metal surface, almost as if it were following the electricity. Pulse sensors
    recorded small energy fluctuations inside the material itself, suggesting it
    generates microcurrents or reacts to those around it.\n\nAttempts to sterilize
    or isolate the sample only slowed it down temporarily. Within minutes, the material
    regrew, reformed, or shifted into a new configuration. The pattern is clear:
    Composite-0 does not behave like rock, crystal, or metal. It behaves like something
    alive\u2014if not biologically, then at least behaviorally.\n\nRecommendation:
    treat Composite-0 as an active hazard.\nDo not handle without protective gear.
    Do not expose to electrical systems unless supervised.\nIt is adapting, and we
    don\u2019t yet know to what end.\n"
