  noteContent: 'Author: Dr. Hart



    Composite-0 continues to defy expectations.
    It reacts rapidly to changes in heat, sound, and even subtle shifts in electrical
    current. Growth along metal surfaces suggests a preference for conductive pathways,
    as if the material "seeks" them out. Attempts to sterilize or isolate it temporarily
    slow expansion, but regrowth occurs within minutes.



    Recommend treating
    Composite-0 as an active hazard rather than a passive sample.
